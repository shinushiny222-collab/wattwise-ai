## 📊 Dataset

### appliances.csv

Contains appliance names and power consumption.

Example:

| Appliance | Watts |
|-----------|------:|
| Fan | 75 |
| LED Bulb | 10 |
| AC | 1500 |
| Refrigerator | 200 |

---

### energy_tips.csv

Contains appliance-wise electricity saving tips.

Example:

| Appliance | Tip |
|-----------|-----|
| Fan | Clean fan blades regularly |
| AC | Set temperature between 24–26°C |

## 🔑 Gemini API Setup

Create a Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.

Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:

```toml
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

Configure it in Python:

```python
import os
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])
```
